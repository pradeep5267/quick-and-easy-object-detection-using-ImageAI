## All credits to the creators of ImageAI library
## This is an ad-hoc implementation of ImageAI to detect objects using YOLOv3
## Full instructions available at https://github.com/OlafenwaMoses/ImageAI/tree/master/imageai/Detection AND I do urge you to read it.<br><br>
- First of all, install the ImageAI library using: pip3 install https://github.com/OlafenwaMoses/ImageAI/releases/download/2.0.3/imageai-2.0.3-py3-none-any.whl or by following the instructions in ImageAI repo.
- Then download the weights for YOLOv3 from: https://github.com/OlafenwaMoses/ImageAI/releases/download/1.0/yolo.h5
- Once you download the object detection model file, you should copy the model file to the your project folder where your .py files will be
- You can either supply the path of the image to be used or by deafault one of the test images will be used.
